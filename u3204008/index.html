                  It was a devastating fire that swept through New South Wales. The firestarted because the average daily temperature in New South
                  Wales was 3.4°C (6.1°F) above the historical average. High fuel loads,combined with warm, dry and windy weather, provided the
                  dangerous conditions that fuelled the fires. At the peak of the fire season, there were over 100 fires across the state. The burned 
                 area reached 118,000 hectares, resulting in two deaths and two injuries and property damage totalling $94 million.</p>

                Continuing a sustained pattern of severe rainfall deficits over 27 months, rising temperatures and thunderstorms leading to
                lightning triggered a new spate of grass fires in South Australia, Australia. Property damage totalled $13 million, with over

              <p>Murray Road bushfire<br>
                Bushfires are burning in western Australia. 
                The origin is that rainfall in the region is
                far below average. A lightning strike in Lane 
                Poole Reserve, a state forest in Jarrah and 
                Marri, sparked two fires in the Lane Poole
                Reserve State Forest, burning near Waroona.
                About 70,000 hectares of land were burned, 
                killing two people and injuring five others. One 
                hundred eighty-one buildings were 
                burned.</p>

                    The Australian bushfires throughout Australia originated from fires started during the Australian bushfire season, lightning strikes,

                    total area destroyed is about 18,636,079 hectares. 34 people died, about 2,600 houses and property were lost (at least 1 billion), 
                    wild animals are estimated to have died, and some species are considered to be extinct.</p>

                  Bushfire seasons occur in New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The bushfire 
                  outlook forecasts an average fire potential in Queensland with good grass growth in many areas leading to an increased risk of 
                  grass fires and above-normal season in the Kimberley region of Western Australia due to good rainfall from tropical cyclones, a 
                  regular but earlier season in the Northern Territory, an above-normal season on the southern coast of New South Wales and a 
                  regular-season elsewhere. The total area destroyed was 250,000 hectares.</p>
