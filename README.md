Assignment Notes 
Programming for Design (11055) Project 3, this assignment required the creation of a One Page Site and I provided the skills I had learned outside of classroom sessions in Javascript for effective design accompaniment using HTML and CSS.
advantage:
1. Use native JavaScript to achieve the effect of page scrolling.
2. The code is concise and easy to read.
3. Good code comments.
4. High code execution efficiency.

Improvements:
Web page:
1. When writing pages, you should pay more attention to the reusability of the code, and deal with some elements uniformly. There are still some deficiencies in this regard.
js aspect:
1. The page scrolling effect is very rigid, if you add animation effects, the experience will be better
2. There are some compatibility issues. There is no problem when running in Google Chrome. If there is a problem in Firefox, it is not compatible with Firefox.
3. The icon size is relatively large, if the size is compressed, it is more conducive to page loading
